# USDT Token Transfer Tracker (Mumbai Polygon Testnet)

## Overview

This is a JavaScript backend application that tracks real-time blockchain data of USDT (Tether) token transfers on the Mumbai Polygon Testnet. The application utilizes MongoDB for data storage and Moralis Streams for real-time data retrieval from the blockchain.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to build a simple backend system that can efficiently monitor and store USDT token transfer events on the Mumbai Polygon Testnet. It can be used as a foundation for building more complex blockchain data tracking applications or as a reference for integrating Moralis Streams with MongoDB.

## Features

- Real-time tracking of USDT token transfers on the Mumbai Polygon Testnet.
- Storing relevant transaction data (sender, receiver, amount, timestamp) in a MongoDB database.
- Easy setup and configuration.
- Minimal and efficient codebase.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 18.5.0 or higher)
- MongoDB cluster connection string


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Guap-Codes/usdt-token-tracker.git
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
cd usdt-token-tracker
npm install
```

## Configuration

1. Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`.

2. Replace the placeholder values in the `.env` file with your actual MongoDB connection URI.

3. Create an account on Moralis.io & create a new stream

4. Get the token address of USDT on the polygon mumbai testnet from mumbai.polygonscan.com

## Usage

To start the application, run the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

The application will begin tracking USDT token transfers on the Mumbai Polygon Testnet in real-time. The incoming transactions will be stored in the MongoDB database specified in the `.env` file.

## Data Schema

The data stored in the MongoDB database will have the following schema:

```json
{
  "_id": "ObjectId", // MongoDB autogenerated ID
  "fromAddress": "string", // Ethereum address of the sender
  "toAddress": "string", // Ethereum address of the receiver
  "value": "string", // USDT token amount transferred
  "valueWithDecimal": "string", // USDT token amount transferred in decimal
  "timestamp": "number" // UNIX timestamp of the transaction
}
```
